# Digital Humanities 110 Assignment 2: Pilot Usability Test
## Introduction 
The College of the Desert website is a digital platform that functions as the hub center for students, faculty, and staff for anything related to the community college. Students go on  this website to access their email, online schooling, and search for available courses or any resources on campus. Faculty and staff also go on this website to do similar tasks in addition to having their own resources associated with administration, councils, and reporting cases when necessary. On this site, they provide the basic information about this school like its location, the yearly calendar, financial aid, and student life. 

I decided to do a heuristic evaluation on the College of the Desert website after frustration of using that website for a long time when I was an attending student. I came to the realization that some of my classmates did not have the time to become involved with school (many due to life circumstances) and were not aware of the resources available like food pantries. (This also aligns with the United Nations Zero Hunger Sustainability goal.) After doing a heuristic evaluation based on these concerns, several usability concerns emerged. The first concern was the visibility of the system status. The food distribution page is really difficult to find on this website because it’s deeply embedded into the site. Without any help from someone else, finding information that’s needed is tricky sometimes. Second, the look of the website looks outdated, which enhances the first issue of difficulty to find things. Third, there is a lack of error prevention for this website.  Fourth, the website does not utilize recognition-based design. 

## Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of a usability test (UT) is to collect empirical data by observing representative end users when they are performing realistic tasks from the product. UT is meant to improve the product through informing the design on how useful and satisfactory it is, preventing frustration through early inspection, and improving profitability by reducing the cost of service and support. A heuristic evaluation is more of a report on suggestions on the product based on a persona, but a UT is using real data from participants. 

Items that I would like to test out through my UT for College of the Desert is: 
* Visibility of system status: ease of finding student resources such as the food pantry
* Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: trustworthiness and 
* Lack of Error Prevention: test the search bar if and when the participant decides to do so
* Recognition Rather than Recall: It forces user to recall locations and remember where information was on the site. 

## Methodology
Breaking down the conduction of the Usability Test

First, I will conduct this interview in a quiet place at my apartment. The materials used will be my 2014 Macbook Air to record the participant and my phone for the moderator to follow along with the participant. The participant and the moderater (me) will be sitting adjacent to each other. I will invite them to the recording first and read the script. I will go over the informed consent for the usability test so that the data is valid. The user will be providing feedback as they do the tasks. The user will also assess quickness of the task, stasifcation, comfortability of the website, and comments or suggestions for improvement. I will end the recording when the production satisfcation card is completed. (In other words, right before the demographic questions which is kept confidential). I will close out the session by thanking my participant for doing the usability testing.

## Reflection

What I learned during the pilot test, what went well and what did not go well, how I want to improve my usability test in the future. 

I learned that I have to be more asserting during the pilot test. I also had to control myself not to give away the answers to the participant because I was so familiar with the site. I think what went well was the actual tasks, except for the last one. The first two went well because my instructions were clear and concise. The last one was a bit more convoluted. She also gave thorough responses as to why she did the thigns the ways she did on the site. The introduction, the consent, and the closeout went well too. What did not go well was my typos on the form. I thought I worked on it well. In the future, I will definitely triple check the previews, or have someone else check over the survey for any errors. I also want to add more tasks related to attending the college itself such as searching up what programs are available, what does a student need to graduate, and more. One last thing I would do is prepare a different device other than my phone to follow along with the participant. The words were to small to read sometimes so I had to bring up the phone closer to my face. I could also alleviate this issue by increasing the font size on the Google Forms itself. This Usability Test was a very informative experience, and I would love to do it again!
